    <h1> Dharan City </h1>
    <p>
        Dharan is a sub-metropolitan city in Sunsari District of Koshi Province, Nepal, which was established as a fourth municipality in the Kingdom in 1958. It is the third most populous city in Eastern Nepal after Biratnagar and Itahari. The Nepali word "dharan" means a saw pit. The rainforest from which the tree trunks came is still just on the edge of the city.
